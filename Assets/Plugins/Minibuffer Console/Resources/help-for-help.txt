Help-for-help
=============

Welcome to Minibuffer, a developer console for Unity. It offers commands, variables, and key bindings. It is made to be discoverable. By knowing a few commands, you can discover everything Minibuffer has to offer.

To recall this buffer, hit 'ctrl-h h' or 'alt-x help-for-help' at any time.

Basics
------

Hit 'alt-x' then 'tab' to see the available commands.  To run the command 'increment-font-size', type 'alt-x inc' then hit 'tab' then hit 'return'.  This command is also bound to a key, so hitting 'ctrl-=' will run it.  This command has a sister command 'decrement-font-size' bound to 'ctrl--'.

Help Commands
-------------

Here are some notable key bindings for Minibuffer that will help you discover what is available.

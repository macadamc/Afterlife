      option 1.\n->This is option 2\n\tYou selected option 2.\n\t<<set $didOption2
      to true>>\n\nBased on choices, you can set variables, and then check those variables
      later.\n<<if $didOption2 is true>>\nBy checking $didOption2, I remember you
      chose option 2!\n<<else>>\nI can't detect a variable $didOption2, so that means
      you chose option 1\n<<endif>>\n\nDo you want to go back to Start now?\n-> Yes,
      send me back to Start.\n\t[[Start]]\n-> No thanks, I want to stop.\n\nOk here's
      the end, good luck!"
